BROWSER EXTENSION DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS
========================================
Last Updated: 2025-10-16

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
FastCoverLetters Chrome Extension - A browser extension that extracts job postings from LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor and sends them to the FastCoverLetters app for batch cover letter generation.

COMPLETED FEATURES
------------------
1. ‚úÖ Extension manifest (Manifest V3)
   - Content scripts for LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor
   - Proper permissions (activeTab, storage, tabs)
   - Host permissions for job sites and localhost

2. ‚úÖ Content Script (content.js)
   - Extracts job data from LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor
   - Multiple extraction strategies for robustness
   - Comprehensive debugging/logging
   - Auto-detection on page load

3. ‚úÖ Popup UI (popup.html, popup.js, popup.css)
   - Extract job button
   - Job preview display
   - Queue management (add, remove, clear)
   - Send batch to app functionality
   - Visual queue list with job cards

4. ‚úÖ Backend Integration (server.js)
   - /api/extension/store-jobs endpoint
   - Token-based job transfer system
   - 5-minute token expiry
   - Extension token retrieval in app

5. ‚úÖ App Integration (public/app.html, public/script.js)
   - Welcome modal explaining extension
   - "Get Chrome Extension" button in header
   - Load jobs from extension token
   - Append new jobs to existing ones (not replace)
   - Proper job numbering for batch processing

6. ‚úÖ Tab Reuse Feature
   - Extension finds existing app tab
   - Reuses tab instead of creating new ones
   - Focuses tab when reused

CURRENT ISSUES BEING DEBUGGED
------------------------------
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è LinkedIn Extraction Failing
   Status: Adding multiple extraction strategies
   Problem: LinkedIn's HTML structure uses obfuscated class names

   Attempted Solutions:
   - Added multiple CSS selector strategies
   - Added h1 tag fallback for title
   - Added company link and selector fallbacks
   - Added extensive console logging for debugging

   Current Extraction Strategies:

   COMPANY:
   - a[href*="/company/"] (primary)
   - .job-details-jobs-unified-top-card__company-name
   - .jobs-unified-top-card__company-name
   - a.app-aware-link[href*="/company/"]
   - [data-test-id="job-details-company-name"]

   TITLE:
   - .job-details-jobs-unified-top-card__job-title
   - .jobs-unified-top-card__job-title
   - h1.job-details-jobs-unified-top-card__job-title
   - h1.jobs-unified-top-card__job-title
   - h2.job-details-jobs-unified-top-card__job-title
   - main h1 (fallback)
   - Paragraph search with pattern matching (last resort)

   DESCRIPTION:
   - Find "About the job" h2 heading
   - Extract all following siblings until next h2
   - Fallback: Search for divs with "responsibilities" or "qualifications"

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Content Script Connection Error
   Status: Fixed with better error message
   Solution: User must refresh LinkedIn page after reloading extension
   Error Message: "Please refresh this LinkedIn page (F5) and try again"

FILES MODIFIED IN THIS SESSION
-------------------------------
1. public/app.html
   - Added permanent "Get Chrome Extension" button to Job Descriptions header

2. public/styles.css
   - Added .btn-extension-link styling (green button)

3. browser-extension/manifest.json
   - Removed icon references (causing load errors)
   - Added "tabs" permission for tab reuse

4. browser-extension/content.js
   - Completely rewrote extractLinkedInJob() function
   - Added multiple extraction strategies for title/company/description
   - Added extensive console.log debugging
   - Enhanced validation with specific error messages

5. browser-extension/popup.js
   - Added tab reuse logic (chrome.tabs.query)
   - Added connection error handling
   - Added debugging logs for tab finding

6. public/script.js
   - Changed to append jobs instead of replacing
   - Count existing jobs and number new ones correctly

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
1. Load Extension:
   - Open chrome://extensions/
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select browser-extension folder

2. Test Extraction:
   - Navigate to LinkedIn job posting
   - Click extension icon
   - Click "Extract & Add to Queue"
   - Check console for debug logs (right-click extension > Inspect popup)

3. Test Batch Send:
   - Extract multiple jobs (they queue up)
   - Click "Send All to FastCoverLetters"
   - Should reuse existing app tab if open
   - Jobs should append to existing list

4. After Reloading Extension:
   - IMPORTANT: Refresh LinkedIn page (F5)
   - Content script only loads on fresh page loads

DEBUGGING TIPS
--------------
1. Check Console Logs:
   Extension Popup Console:
   - Right-click extension icon ‚Üí "Inspect popup"
   - See extraction attempts and responses

   LinkedIn Page Console:
   - F12 on LinkedIn job page
   - See content script logs (extraction details)

2. Common Errors:
   - "Could not establish connection" = Refresh LinkedIn page
   - "Could not extract: title, company" = LinkedIn structure changed
   - "Failed to send jobs" = Server not running

3. Debug Console Logs to Look For:
   - "Extracting LinkedIn job from: [URL]"
   - "Company link found: true/false"
   - "Company extracted: [name]"
   - "Title found via selector: [which selector]"
   - "Title extracted: [title]"
   - "Found X h2 elements, looking for 'About the job'"
   - "Description extracted (length): [number]"
   - "Validating extracted data: {hasJobData, hasTitle, hasCompany...}"

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
1. LinkedIn HTML Structure:
   - Uses dynamically generated/obfuscated class names
   - Structure changes frequently
   - May need periodic updates to selectors

2. Content Script Loading:
   - Only loads on page load (document_idle)
   - Requires page refresh after extension reload
   - Cannot retroactively inject into open tabs

3. Tab Reuse:
   - Checks for localhost:3000/app URL
   - Needs update for production domain

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. ‚è≥ Debug why title/company extraction is failing
   - Need console logs from user's LinkedIn page
   - May need to inspect actual HTML structure
   - Might need more selector strategies

2. ‚è≥ Test description extraction
   - Verify "About the job" h2 exists
   - Check if fallback description extraction works

3. ‚è≥ Test complete end-to-end flow:
   - Extract 3-5 jobs from LinkedIn
   - Send to app (verify tab reuse)
   - Generate cover letters for batch
   - Download all results

4. üìã Future Enhancements:
   - Add Indeed/Glassdoor testing
   - Add extension icon (16x16, 48x48, 128x128)
   - Update URLs for production deployment
   - Add better error recovery
   - Add progress indicator for batch operations
   - Add "Extract all jobs from this page" feature

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
----------------------
1. Content Script:
   - Runs on job site pages
   - Extracts DOM data
   - Responds to popup messages

2. Popup:
   - User interface
   - Sends messages to content script
   - Manages job queue in chrome.storage
   - Communicates with backend API

3. Backend API:
   - Stores jobs temporarily (5 min expiry)
   - Generates tokens for transfer
   - Serves jobs to app via token

4. App:
   - Retrieves jobs via extensionToken parameter
   - Appends to existing job list
   - Processes batch cover letter generation

ERROR MESSAGES & MEANINGS
--------------------------
1. "Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist."
   ‚Üí Content script not loaded. Refresh the LinkedIn page.

2. "Please refresh this LinkedIn page (F5) and try again."
   ‚Üí Same as above, user-friendly version.

3. "Could not extract: title, company. Try scrolling down..."
   ‚Üí Extraction selectors failed. LinkedIn structure may have changed.

4. "Failed to extract complete job information from this page."
   ‚Üí Generic extraction failure (old error, replaced with specific one).

5. "This job is already in the queue"
   ‚Üí Duplicate detection working (by URL or title+company).

6. "Failed to send jobs to server"
   ‚Üí Backend not reachable or endpoint error.
