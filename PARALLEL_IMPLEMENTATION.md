# Parallel Job Processing Implementation

## Summary

Implementing parallel processing with 5 concurrent jobs to reduce total processing time from ~3.5 minutes to ~60-80 seconds.

## Apify Concurrency Limits Analysis

**SAFE FOR 5 CONCURRENT JOBS:**
- Global limit: 250,000 requests/minute
- Per-Actor limit: 60 requests/second
- Request Queue CRUD: 400 requests/second
- **Conclusion**: Even with all 5 jobs hitting Apify simultaneously, we use only 5 requests - well within all limits

## Implementation Strategy

### Current (Sequential):
```
Job 1 → Job 2 → Job 3 → Job 4 → Job 5 → Job 6 → Job 7 → Job 8
Total time: ~199 seconds (all sequential)
```

### New (Parallel Batches of 5):
```
Batch 1: Job 1, Job 2, Job 3, Job 4, Job 5 (parallel)
Batch 2: Job 6, Job 7, Job 8 (parallel)
Estimated total time: ~60-80 seconds
```

## Code Changes Required

### Location: server.js lines 750-780

**Replace the sequential for-loop with:**

1. **Batch Processing Loop**: Process jobs in batches of 5
2. **Promise.allSettled()**: Execute jobs in each batch concurrently
3. **Error Handling**: Each job handles its own errors independently
4. **Performance Logging**: Track time per batch and overall time

### Key Benefits

- **3x faster**: 199s → ~60-80s for 8 jobs
- **Apify-safe**: Well within API limits
- **Error-resilient**: Individual job failures don't affect others
- **Scalable**: Easy to adjust batch size (currently 5)
- **Better UX**: Users see results much faster

### Testing Plan

1. Test with 8 job URLs (same ones from previous test)
2. Verify time reduction from ~2.5 minutes to ~1 minute
3. Check that all 8 cover letters generate successfully
4. Monitor server logs for parallel execution
5. Verify no Apify rate limit errors

## Expected Performance

- **8 jobs (2 batches)**: ~60-80s (vs 199s sequential)
- **5 jobs (1 batch)**: ~30-40s (vs 100s sequential)
- **10 jobs (2 batches)**: ~60-90s (vs 250s sequential)

## Implementation Complete

The parallel processing implementation has been added to server.js with:
- Batch size of 5 concurrent jobs
- Promise.allSettled() for error-resilient parallel execution
- Comprehensive logging for performance tracking
- Proper handling of usage limits mid-batch
