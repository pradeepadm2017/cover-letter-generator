#### **Mode 2: Paste Job Description**

Use this mode if you want to manually enter job details or if the URL scraping doesn't work.

1. Click the **"Paste Job Description"** tab
2. Fill in the job details:
   - **Job Title** (required)
   - **Company Name** (required)
   - **Job Description** (required) - Copy and paste the full job posting text
